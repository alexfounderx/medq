## Progress update — August 16  

Completed Phase 2.1 & 2.2:
- Implemented Firebase authentication (login/signup flow + AuthContext)
- Integrated Supabase (Postgres) for persistent user profiles
- Created `users` table: UID, email, display_name, specialty, ELO
- Added onboarding step: specialty selection
- Dashboard now displays user specialty + starting ELO (1000)

📍 Next:  
- Filter questions by specialty  
- Update ELO dynamically after SoloQ rounds  
- Start building the ranking system  

MedQ is moving from basic auth to structured user data. The foundation for specialty-based practice and ELO-driven progression is now live.
